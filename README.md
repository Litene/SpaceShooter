Create a small space shooter game with the following features:

Simple movement:
	I use the mouse to move the orientation of the ship.
Shooting:
	The mouse button fires a projectile; you can hold it to shoot faster.
Waves of enemies:
	The enemies start coming 2/s; I wanted to showcase the performance, so every 20th 	second, the spawn rate is increased by a factor of 1.2. 

Using Unity DOTS, requirements are met just by getting everything to work; you can only use unmanageable datatypes by default; you separate the data, the systems, and the entities. Which makes it easier for the processor to utilize the L1, L2, L3 cache. I utilized Unity's burst compiler to improve the performance, and the project is heavily multithreaded. On my computer with a new AMD Ryzen 5 7600, with 12 threads, it has a stable FPS between 1200-3900. I, therefore, included relevant information in the build to showcase performance rather than focusing on the gameplay aspect.

I spend most of my time learning DOTS and data-oriented design and doing things right from the beginning, trying not to cut corners. One thing that was extremely weird to me was not to cache variables in the class/struct and rather just reassign them in the OnUpdate method; this is apparently how it is supposed to be done since you donâ€™t want to clutter your systems with variables and which go against the data-oriented design philosophy, I also learned that this is okay to do since no memory is reallocated, it is cached and will just fetch the previous instance of it. 

Regarding changes and decisions I took to increase performance, the biggest decision was to use collisions rather than distance checks; this proved challenging since the documentation was outdated and almost nothing worked. A full week went into getting collisions to work fully.
